Debugging WordPress can sometimes be a pain, which is why **Loginator** was built to simplify the process. From automatically creating and securing a log folder to intelligently handling different types of logs, Loginator helps you save time and focus on building great applications.

Once activated, Loginator essentially becomes a core part of WordPress, which is why **plugin deactivation is disabled** to prevent runtime errors from missing log functions.
